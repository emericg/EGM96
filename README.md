EGM96
=====


## Introduction

### Origin

This project is a fork of [a project](https://sourceforge.net/projects/egm96-f477-c.) by D.Ineiev, containings a rought translation from Fortran to C of [that EGM96 implementation](http://earth-info.nga.mil/GandG/wgs84/gravitymod/egm96/egm96.html). EGM96 and CORRCOEF files from that site are just filtered with sed -e"s/D/E/g".
