EGM96
=====


## Introduction

This C library is designed for the calculation of a geoid undulation at a point whose latitude and longitude is specified.

**TL:DR** It's meant to correct altitudes given by GPS systems, that mesure altitude against the ellipsoid and needs to be corrected to match the geoid.

### How to use

The library is meant to be easy to use.

* Include in your project the three files _EEM96.c_, _EGM96.h_ and _EGM96_data.h_
* Call the _egm96_compute_altitude_offset_ function:

```
/*!
 * \brief Compute the geoid undulation from the EGM96 potential coefficient model, for a given latitude and longitude.
 * \param latitude: Latitude in degrees.
 * \param longitude: Longitude in degrees.
 * \return The geoid undulation / altitude offset (in meters).
 */
double egm96_compute_altitude_offset(double lat, double lon);
```

### About the science

The [World Geodetic System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Geodetic_System) (WGS) is a standard for use in cartography, geodesy, and satellite navigation including GPS. This standard includes the definition of the coordinate system's fundamental and derived constants, the ellipsoidal (normal) [Earth Gravitational Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_Gravitational_Model) (EGM), a description of the associated [World Magnetic Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Magnetic_Model) (WMM), and a current list of local datum transformations.

The **EGM96 geoid defines** the nominal sea level surface by means of a spherical harmonics series of degree 360. The deviations of the EGM96 geoid from the WGS 84 reference ellipsoid range from about âˆ’105 m to about +85 m.

In geodesy, a **reference ellipsoid** is a mathematically defined surface that approximates the geoid, which is the truer, imperfect figure of the Earth, or other planetary body, as opposed to a perfect, smooth, and unaltered sphere, which factors in the undulations of the bodies' gravity due to variations in the composition and density of the interior, as well as the subsequent flattening caused by the centrifugal force from the rotation of these massive objects (for planetary bodies that do rotate).

### About the original implementation

This project is a fork of [a project](https://sourceforge.net/projects/egm96-f477-c.) by D.Ineiev, containings a rought translation from Fortran to C of an [EGM96 implementation](https://earth-info.nga.mil/GandG/wgs84/gravitymod/egm96/egm96.html) from the [National Geospacial-intelligence Agency](https://earth-info.nga.mil/).
